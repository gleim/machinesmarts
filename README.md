=============

Before machine learning packages were off the shelf, they had to be created from scratch.

This is a simple machine learning architecture for embedded devices.  The architecture segregates device control & low-level data processing from the higher-level learning & predictive elements.  Implementation has not been optimized.

This code is the basis of a networked embedded autonomous vehicle guidance system that passed several qualifying stages of the DARPA Grand Challenge 2005.
